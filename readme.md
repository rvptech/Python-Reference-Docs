# Python

- Programming is the ability to provide a computer, with a set of instructions in a particular language, that it can understand and perform those operations.

<mark>NOTE : Use whitespaces and indentation correctly</mark>

- Python was created by Guido Van Rossum, 1991.

- Python is a high level, interpreted, object oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 

- Python is widely used for web development, data analysis and automation.

### Indentation:

- Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces.

### DataTypes :

- Numbers : Integer, Float, Complex Numbers
- Sequence : String, List and Tuple
- Dictionary
- Boolean
- Set

- List, Dictionary and Set are mutable datatypes, remaining are immutable.

<mark>NOTE : Everything in Python is an Object</mark>

### Type casting :

- It is a process of converting one datatype to another.

- There are two types : Implicit conversion and Explicit conversion.

<mark>NOTE : If datatypes are not compatible for conversion, python will throw an error (Type error)</mark>


### Python - Variable Names:

<mark>NOTE : Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.</mark>

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.


#### Global Variables:

- Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables.

- Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
